When I look for an app, I usually search for it on Google. It's quite surprising that the top results are all about **free** apps. Their websites must already have a huge number of visitors to be popped up on the first page of search. People are not really willing to pay. Why on earth would someone pay for an app when there's a free one that solves the same problem? With this question in mind, software companies dig for new ways to make money. The business of software has shifted.

The traditional business is pretty simple and straightforward: you write software, then sell it. Customers need your software and you need their money, nothing more. Google Play and Apple Store, for example, are two large marketplaces for this kind of business. Now look at the tech giants now. Does Google charge you each time you type a search on their engine? Does Instagram ask you to pay for each photo you upload on it? The same goes for Facebook. You don't have to spend a single penny to use their services. That's what everybody wants in the first place.

Their dominance is spreading like wildfire, enough to beget "free apps" culture. Thanks to their efforts, people now can easily find free apps. And their minds are set to think there's always a free app to accomplish their task, by default. Some geeks even try to modify, break, or edit source code in order to make paid apps free, then publish them on their website. It can't be easier to find a place where you can download them.

So yes, software companies make tremendous works to change their business model; they offer their services for free. It's not because they want to, it's because they have to. That's where the big question comes into sight: how do they make money? They sure don't establish a company for fun. The answer is users' data. Not only does data generate revenue for them, it helps retain users as well. They thoroughly hit two birds with one stone.

# When you don't know where their yields come from, you are the yield.

Imagine you have someone noticing everything you do, as [The Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police) sing:

> Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you
Oh, can't you see
**You belong to me?**

That's exactly what those free apps are doing to you. They have a strong clue about what you like (and what you don't.) The fact that there are people who lose track of time by watching TikTok tells us how strong the clue is. Facebook won't miss any chance to "listen" to you with every click you make on their website and every message you write. When you keep using their services, you keep giving them more information about yourself, about what you want, and about your needs,... The more data they have, the better their clues are. Just sign up and use their service, then they will take care of the rest. Everything is beautiful.

Until advertisements are everywhere. Companies pay Facebook to run advertisements. Because Facebook owns a large database of users, they know exactly who their potential customers are. And the data of every single user is extremely detailed, more than one could imagine. It should not surprise you that companies such as Facebook and Google are advertising companies, since more than 80% of their revenues are from advertising. 

Most of the time, advertisements are what you're interested in, or what you've been thinking of. It's weird how accurate they are. Much too personal. There's nothing you can do about it. You ticked the "agree" box on their terms without hesitation. It turns out, when you don't know where their yields come from, you are the yield. Users' data is a gold mine of information to make money from. See, they're making billions, if not hundreds of billions, just from advertising. You don't pay money for their service, but **you pay them your privacy**. In some respects, free apps are not actually free.
